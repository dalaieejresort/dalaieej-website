I need to completely refactor `app/[locale]/page.tsx` and the navigation system to match a "Luxury Editorial" aesthetic.

Please perform the following 5 steps:

STEP 1: CREATE THE "CURTAIN" NAVIGATION OVERLAY
Create `components/layout/NavigationOverlay.tsx`:
- Use `framer-motion` for a smooth slide-down or fade-in animation.
- **State:** It should take `isOpen` and `onClose` props.
- **Layout:** A full-screen overlay (z-50) with a dark forest green background.
- **Content:**
  - **Left Col:** Large Serif links (4xl+): STAY, NOURISH, RESTORE, ROAM, OFFERS, ABOUT, VISIT.
  - **Right Col:** A placeholder image that changes based on which link is hovered.
  - **Footer:** Small utility links (Contact, Socials) at the bottom.

STEP 2: REFACTOR THE NAVBAR
Update `components/layout/Navbar.tsx`:
- **Remove:** All central text links (Stay, Dining, etc.).
- **Left:** Keep the "Dalai Eej" Logo.
- **Right:**
  1. Language Switcher.
  2. "BOOK" Button.
  3. A new "MENU" Button (Hamburger icon) that toggles the `NavigationOverlay`.
- **Behavior:** The Navbar should be transparent at the top and become solid/glassmorphism on scroll.

STEP 3: CREATE THE HERO GRID (THE "SILOS")
Create `components/home/HeroGrid.tsx`:
- This replaces the current video hero.
- **Layout:** A "Bento Grid" (CSS Grid) with 4 quadrants.
- **Content (Mock Data):**
  1. **"The Sanctuary"** (Gers) - Image: Unsplash ID `1598286950-c8c7c9e0d8b3` (Cozy cabin/ger interior).
  2. **"The Hearth"** (Nourish) - Image: Unsplash ID `1504674900247-0877df9cc836` (Plated food).
  3. **"The Stillness"** (Restore) - Image: Unsplash ID `1544161515-4ab6ce6db874` (Spa/Relaxation).
  4. **"The Wilderness"** (Roam) - Image: Unsplash ID `1553284965-83fd3e82fa5a` (Horses/Nature).
- **Style:** Each quadrant acts as a link. On hover, the image scales slightly and the text overlay brightens.

STEP 4: CREATE THE INTRO & OFFERS
1. Create `components/home/EditorialIntro.tsx`:
   - Simple text component: "A refuge at the edge of the world. Where the taiga meets the blue pearl." + "Discover Our Story" link.
2. Create `components/home/OffersCarousel.tsx`:
   - A simple horizontal scroll of cards (e.g., "Stay 4 Pay 3", "Honeymoon Escape").

STEP 5: CREATE THE JOURNEYS TABS
Create `components/home/JourneysTabs.tsx`:
- Headline: "Find Your Rhythm".
- Tabs: "For Two" (Romance), "The Tribe" (Family), "Solitude" (Solo).
- Content: Clicking a tab shows a specific image and a short itinerary list.

STEP 6: ASSEMBLE THE HOMEPAGE
Rewrite `app/[locale]/page.tsx` with this exact structure:
1. `<Navbar />` (Fixed)
2. `<NavigationOverlay />` (Conditional)
3. `<HeroGrid />`
4. `<EditorialIntro />`
5. `<OffersCarousel />`
6. `<JourneysTabs />`
7. `<InteractiveMap />` (Existing component)
8. `<Footer />` (Existing component)
9. `<AvailabilityBar />` (Existing component)
