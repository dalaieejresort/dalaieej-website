I need a responsive "Amenities & Guest Experience" page for Dalai Eej Resort. Please use HTML and Tailwind CSS.

Design Style:
Clean & Atmospheric: Use plenty of whitespace, large high-quality imagery, and elegant typography (Serif for headings, Sans-serif for body).
Color Palette: Deep Lake Blues, Warm Wood/Canvas tones, and White.
Layout Structure:
Hero Section: Centered text "The Jewel of Khuvsgul" with a brief intro paragraph.
Key Amenities List: A 2-column section. Left side is a list of bullet points (Key Amenities). Right side is a large featured image.
Alternating Feature Blocks: Three sections (Dining, Activities, Relaxation) where the image and text swap positions (Left/Right zigzag pattern).
"Your Stay Includes" (Inclusions): A centered section with a 2-column list of icons/checks for things like Breakfast, Firewood, etc.
Testimonials Carousel/Grid: A section with 3 cards featuring guest reviews.
Resort Policies (Accordion): A clean, expandable list (like an FAQ style) for "Check-in/Out", "Cancellations", "Pet Policy", "Quiet Hours".
