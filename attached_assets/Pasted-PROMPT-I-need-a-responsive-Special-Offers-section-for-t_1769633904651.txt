PROMPT:

I need a responsive "Special Offers" section for the Dalai Eej Resort website (Summer 2026 season). Please use HTML and CSS (you can use Tailwind CSS if it's easier, or plain CSS).

Design Requirements:
Layout: A 3-column grid on desktop, 2-column on tablet, 1-column on mobile.
Card Style: Similar to the "Meritage" style—Image at the top, followed by a Title, a short Description, the Highlighted Offer (e.g., "25% Off"), and a "Book Now" button.
Colors: Use natural tones suitable for a lake resort (Blues, Whites, soft Earth tones).
Since I don't have a nav bar yet, please make this a self-contained section I can paste into my landing page.
